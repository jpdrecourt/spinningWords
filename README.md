# Spinning words

A very tentative attempt at sound art based on the poem [Anne Hathaway by Carol Ann Dufy][1].
Use o-p for left-right, q-a for up-down. Best played by two lovers, one for each
set of key.

Sit comfortably close and try not to talk. Listen to the sounds and communicate
through body language.

Various female voices extracted using http://youglish.com.
Final recording of the poem by the author. Background music: [Fantasia by Robert Johnson][2]
