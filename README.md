# Spinning words

Based on the poem [Anne Hathaway by Carol Ann Dufy][1],
this is a sound art for lovers. One tries to point to the spinning word, the
other presses the space bar in good time to build the poem word by word.

Sit comfortably close and try not to talk. Listen to the sounds and communicate
through body language.
