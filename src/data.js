  "The bed we loved in was a spinning world",
  "of forests, castles, torchlight, cliff-tops, seas",
  "where he would dive for pearls. My lover's words",
  "were shooting stars which fell to earth as kisses",
  "on these lips; my body now a softer rhyme",
  "to his, now echo, assonance; his touch",
  "a verb dancing in the centre of a noun.",
  "Some nights I dreamed he'd written me, the bed",
  "a page beneath his writer's hands. Romance",
  "and drama played by touch, by scent, by taste.",
  "In the other bed, the best, our guests dozed on,",
  "dribbling their prose. My living laughing love â€“ ",
  "I hold him in the casket of my widow's head",
  "as he held me upon that next best bed."
